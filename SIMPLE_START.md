## Still Confused? Let's Break It Down Even More

### What is Terminal?
- It's like a text-based way to talk to your computer
- Instead of clicking buttons, you type commands
- It's like texting your computer

### What is npm?
- It's a "package manager" - a tool that gets other tools
- Like an app store, but for code tools
- Comes with Node.js automatically

### What is Next.js?
- It's a framework (a pre-built structure) for making websites
- Like a template for building houses
- Makes building websites easier

### What is localhost?
- It means "this computer"
- `localhost:3000` = "the website running on MY computer"
- Only you can see it (until you deploy it)
